# Pre-requisite-check

####DESCRIPTION

This program creates a visual representation of all the pre-requisite classes that need to be taken for a specific class. 
It is recursive in nature and hence show the pre-requisites for the pre-requisite classes till the lowest (one which does 
not have pre-requisites) is reached.

####SKILLS USED
1. Using, accesing and modifying n-ary structures.
2. Implementing and using hash tables for faster access.
3. Using advanced graphics concepts to visualize the tree-like structures.
